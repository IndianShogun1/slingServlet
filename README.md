# slingServlet

1. Create a sling servlet to list out all the blogs in such a way so that we can display the blogs along with creation date and sort it by date in either way, (both option should be there to sort in ascending and descending order).

2. Create a servlet and register it by path, which should print the blog in PDF format.
